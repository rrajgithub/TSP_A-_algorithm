Problem:

In the traveling salesman Problem, a salesman must visits n cities. We can say that salesman wishes to make a tour or Hamiltonian cycle, visiting each city exactly once and finishing at the city he starts from. There is a non-negative cost c (i, j) to travel from the city i to city j. The goal is to find a tour of minimum cost. We assume that every two cities are connected. Such problems are called Traveling-salesman problem (TSP).
We can model the cities as a complete graph of n vertices, where each vertex represents a city.
